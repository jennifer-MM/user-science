          <p>In this post, we'll talk about how a local library uses their digital platform to provide information and a
            service. In <i>Don't
              Make me Think Revisited,</i> Steve Krug, explains that, if something is usable, it means that,</p>

          <blockquote class="blockquote"><b>"A person of average (or even below everage) ability and experience can figure
            out how to use the thing to accomplish something without it being more trouble than it's worth".</b>
          </blockquote>

          <p>Using this definition, we'll talk about what's going well on the site and opportunities to make it easier
            for people to use.</p>

          <p>This week's usability analysis is of the Manlius Library website. This website allows users to view and
            register for
            programs and events, provides information about library resources and is a gateway to access third-party
            websites like the county site to browse and reserve
            books.</p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">Introduction</h2>

          <p>The Manlius Library serves all residents residing in the Fayetteville-Manlius (New York) school districts’
            communities. It is a community center that:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Loans books and other materials like DVDs</li>
            <li>Provide programs and events for people of all ages</li>
            <li>Offers meeting rooms for community organizations and groups</li>
            <li>Free access to online databases and resources</li>
          </ul>

          <p>The website located at www.manliuslibrary.org serves as an information and service platform for all
            community members. Its mission is, “to enrich lives by empowering people, inspiring ideas, and building
            community. .</p>

          <p> When you look at the website, you can tell that its a team full of people who want to help the
            public, it serves. It promotes a lot of programs and services- But I think it could be more effective it the
            information is displayed in a way that easier for visitors to understand.</p>

          <!-- <blockquote class="blockquote">The dreams of yesterday are the hopes of today and the reality of tomorrow.
            Science has not yet mastered prophecy. We predict too much for the next year and yet far too little for the
            next ten.</blockquote> -->


          <!-- <h2 class="section-heading">Executive Summary</h2>

          <p>As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a
            marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so
            delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to change a
            man.</p> -->

          <h2 class="section-heading">Methodology</h2>

          <p>We're going to answer four questions about the site to learn about its usability. The questions are:</p>

          <ol>
            <li>Do we need to read everything, to understand what's going on?</li>
            <li>What's important on the page?</li>
            <li>What should I click?</li>
            <li>How easily can I find what I need?</li>
          </ol>

          <h2 class="methodology-heading">Do we need to read everything, to understand what's going on?</h2>

          <p>Visitors to the library's homepage, are overwhelmed with information, colors, and images. Visitors must
            think when they are here. Visitors must read; rather than scan the page for a key word or phrase to help us
            get to where we need to go.</p>

          <p>One critical flaw with this layout is that its not accessible for visually impaired people. The photographs
            do not have alt-text and the multiple text headers overlayed on the photographs are difficult to read.</p>

          <a href="#">
            <img class="img-fluid" src="img/entire-home-page .png" alt="image of the Manlius Library homepage">
          </a>
          <span class="caption text-muted">screen capture, www.manliuslibrary.org</span>

          <p>Recommendations include to make the website accessible for screen readers and use a layout that removes
            white
            text from photographs. I'd want to see the page formateed so it supports scanning and remove repetitive
            information like the two navigation bar that
            include the social links </p>


          <h2 class="methodology-heading">What's important on the page?</h2>

          <p>It is challenging for visitors to know what's important on this site. There are so many colors and
            photographs that nothing stands out. It's a prime example that, if everything is important, than nothing is
            important. </p>


          <p>The site would benefit from a clear information hierarchy and a clean design- </p>

          <h2 class="methodology-heading">What should I click?</h2>

          <p>Where to click to get the information you're looking for is not clear. An example is the Digital Resources
            page. The large blue image. Is just an image- It takes up a large amount of space and doesn't provide
            anything of value. It's not a link- nor is it particularly pretty. The links on the right hand side- are
            plopped there with zero explanation. Those are different digital resources, library care holders have access
            too- but that's not explained any where. Visitors are expected to know that information.</p>

          <a href="#">
            <img class="img-fluid" src="img/digital-library-page.png"
              alt="image of the Manlius Library Digital Resource homepage">
          </a>
          <span class="caption text-muted">screen capture, www.manliuslibrary.org</span>

          <p>One recommendation is to redesign this page with the intent to make the most useful content prominent for
            site visitors. Make what's clickable, obvious.</p>

          <h2 class="methodology-heading">How easily can I find information?</h2>

          <p>The website is full of useful information- but its hard to sift through the noise to find what you need.
            Information is not consistent. The information hierarchy in the drop down menus isn't consistent with the
            content on the page.
          </p>

          <a href="#">
            <img class="img-fluid" src="img/browse-&-borrow-selection-options.png"
              alt="image of the Manlius Library Digital Resource homepage">
          </a>
          <span class="caption text-muted">screen capture, www.manliuslibrary.org</span>

          <p>One recommendation is to make the information consistent. Understanding that the page is used by a large
            and diverse customer base, it may help to run user- testing like card sorting or observing people completing
            tasks- to better understand where your customers look for information.</p>
