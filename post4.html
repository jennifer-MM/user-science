          <h2 class="section-heading">Introduction</h2>

          <p>I transitioned from last week's usability study on JoAnn.com, desktop version, to its mobile site.</p>

          <p><a href="https://www.joann.com">JoAnn.com</a> is an e-commerce business, providing visitors the
            opportunity to
            purchase fabric and craft supplies. The mobile site provides an informational section to inspire
            visitors to try new craft projects, promote sales, and feature products.</p>

          <p>I conducted a virtual usability test using a live version of JoAnn.com using Zoom, a video
            conferencing platform. The session captured each participant's navigational choices, task
            completion rates, comments, and overall satisfaction rating, questions and feedback.</p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">Executive Summary</h2>

          <p>The virtual usability test assesses the usability of the web interface design, information flow,
            and information architecture. It was conducted on Friday, May 1, 2020 and Saturday, May 2,
            2020.
            Three people participated in the test during their own session. Test scenarios were the same
            over the two days.</p>

          <p>The purpose of the test is to determine whether the website is easy to use. This report is a combination of
            the results and recommendations from both sets of users. The challenges and recommendations are similar.
            This is a result of the the mobile site having the identical content and features as the desktop version-
            rather than being designed </p>

          <p>The challenges and recommendations are similar. This is a result of the the mobile site having identical
            content and features as the desktop version-
            It was not designed to meet the unique needs of a mobile user.</p>

          <p>The test identified problems including:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Lack of capability to search individual stores' stock</li>
            <li>Confusion of the process to order online and pick up at local store</li>
            <li>COVID-19 pop up distracts users</li>
            <li>Overwhelming amount of information and images</li>
            <li>The pages are too long without having a "scroll up" feature-</li>
          </ul>

            <img class="img-fluid" src="img/usability-test/covid-message.jpg" alt="image COVID pop-up on JoAnn.com">

          <span class="caption text-muted">screen capture, www.joann.com on a mobile device. This informational COVID-19
            pop-up appears on every new page a user visits.</span>

          <p>The information contained here includes the participant feedback, task completion rates, ease or
            difficulty of completion rating, errors and recommendations for improvement.

            A copy of the instructions and task scenarios are included at the end of the report.</p>

          <!--- <blockquote class="blockquote">The dreams of yesterday are the hopes of today and the reality of
                        tomorrow.
                        Science has not yet mastered prophecy. We predict too much for the next year and yet far too
                        little for the
                        next ten.</blockquote> -->


          <!-- <h2 class="section-heading">Executive Summary</h2>

          <p>As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a
            marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so
            delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to change a
            man.</p> -->

          <h2 class="section-heading">Methodology</h2>

          <p>The user tests were conducted over two days. Each session was approximately 10 minutes in length.
            Participants were asked to complete three tasks. Post-scenario measures included:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>How easy it was to find the information </li>
            <li>How confident were you that you knew which section of the website contained the information
              you needed</li>
            <li>Ability to keep track of their location</li>
          </ul>
          <!---<ol>
                        <li>What can I find and do here?</li>
                        <li>Are navigation elements clear?</li>
                        <li>You are here. Where am I?</li>
                        <li>Does the site provide useful results to a keyword search?</li> 
                    </ol>-->

          <h2 class="section-heading">Participants</h2>

          <p>I recruited three participants for the usability test. All three woman are in the 30-56 years-old
            age range. All three have previously shopped inside a JoAnn's store, but have not previously
            used the website on a mobile device.</p>

          <!--<a href="#">

                    <span class="caption text-muted">screen capture, www.townofmanlius.org</span>-->

          <h3 class="methodology-heading">Evaluation Tasks and Scenarios</h3>

          <p><b>Test task:</b> Buy an assorted package of acrylic paints, that are available to pick up at the
            store.</p>
          <p><b>Test scenario:</b> You want to avoid going into JoAnn’s tomorrow but need acrylic paint for a
            project. You decide to us the store’s drive-up feature. Find a multi-pack of paints that are
            available for pick up at your local JoAnn store.</p>
          <p><b>Test task:</b> Buy 12 ft. of fabric</p>
          <p><b>Test scenario:</b> You’re making a blanket for your son. His favorite superhero is Spiderman.
            Find a Spiderman fabric and add it to your cart.</p>
          <p><b>Test task:</b> Buy a cake pan</p>
          <p><b>Test Task</b> You’re baking a sheet cake next week and need a new pan. Find a the top rated
            9x13 cake pan and add it to your cart.</p>

          <h2 class="methodology-heading">Results</h2>

          <p>Two participants were able to locate a package of acrylic paints that were available at their local store.
            The third participant, with experience using mobile applications, not shopping using a website on a mobile
            device, was uable to navigate to the "Paint" inventory. </p>

          <p>All participants completed Task 2 and 3. Every participant expressed frustration with scrolling through the
            inventory.</p>


          <h3 class="methodology-heading">Overall Ratings</h3>

          <p>After the completion of the test, participants rated the overall site using the 5-point rating
            scale from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree).</p>

          </a>-->



          <h2 class="methodology-heading">Recommendations</h2>

          <p>Users want to see changes that will make it easier to navigate and reduce the visual distractions on the
            homepage.
          </p>

          <ol>
            <li>Create a separate mobile version of JoAnn.com and prioritize the information and products mobile users
              want. When <i>everything</i> is important, than <i>nothing</i> is important.</li>
            <li>Remove the COVID-19 information pop up from appearing every time a new page loads. It's a help resource
              for customers that only needs to appear once throughout their visit.</li>
            <li>Add the capability to search local stores' inventory.</li>
            <li>The pages are very long. Its frustrating to navigate. The site should give users the opportunity to
              "scroll up" quickly and have access to the navigation bar without having to scroll all the way to the top.
            </li>

          </ol>
